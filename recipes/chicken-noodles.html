            <li> Season chicken strips to taste with salt and pepper. Add olive oil to a medium-sized skillet and cook chicken in an even layer over medium heat, turning from time to time for 2 or 3 minutes, until slightly golden. Stir in the garlic, and carrots and cook for a minute more, until cooked through but not overdone.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked spaghetti and broccoli to the skillet and pour the sauce on top and toss until fully incorporated. Reheat for a couple of minutes and serve the chicken stir fry noodles, garnished with scallion and toasted sesame seeds. Enjoy!</li>
