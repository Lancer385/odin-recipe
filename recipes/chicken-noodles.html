            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To make the chicken stir fry noodles recipe: In a large pot with boiling salted water, cook the spaghetti according to package directions. Add the broccoli florets the last 5 minutes of cooking and let them cook with pasta until tender. Drain the noodles and broccoli and set aside.</li>
                <li>While pasta is cooking, whisk together the brown sugar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, ginger, red pepper, and black pepper in a small bowl.</li>
                <li> Season chicken strips to taste with salt and pepper. Add olive oil to a medium-sized skillet and cook chicken in an even layer over medium heat, turning from time to time for 2 or 3 minutes, until slightly golden. Stir in the garlic, and carrots and cook for a minute more, until cooked through but not overdone.</li>
                <li>Transfer the cooked spaghetti and broccoli to the skillet and pour the sauce on top and toss until fully incorporated. Reheat for a couple of minutes and serve the chicken stir fry noodles, garnished with scallion and toasted sesame seeds. Enjoy!</li>
