                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.</li>
                    <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
                    <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
